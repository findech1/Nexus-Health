4. **Appointment Scheduling**: Schedules and manages appointments between patients and providers with real-time availability checking, calendar integration, and reminders.
5. **Video Conferencing Integration**: Uses third-party solutions like Twilio for virtual consultations.
6. **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**: Manages electronic health records, including medical histories, test results, and treatment plans.
7. **Billing and Payment**: Integrates with Stripe for secure billing and payments.
8. **Notifications and Messaging**: Notifies patients and providers about appointments, updates, and important information.
9. **Reporting and Analytics**: Tracks usage, generates insights, and monitors system performance.

### Front-end (Tailwind CSS)
